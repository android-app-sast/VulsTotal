# VulsTotal
VulsTotal: A Unified Platform for Evaluating SAST Tools for Android.
The platform combines the detection capability of 11 selected SAST tools for Android and finally generates a comprehensive detection report (CSV file) for the target APK.
The 11 selected SAST tools for Android are:

- [MobSF](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF)
- [QARK](https://github.com/linkedin/qark)
- [AndroBugs](https://github.com/AndroBugs/AndroBugs_Framework)
- [APKHunt](https://github.com/Cyber-Buddy/APKHunt)
- [SUPER](https://github.com/SUPERAndroidAnalyzer/super)
- [JAADAS](https://github.com/flankerhqd/JAADAS)
- [DroidStatx](https://github.com/clviper/droidstatx)
- [Marvin](https://github.com/programa-stic/Marvin-static-Analyzer)
- [Trueseeing](https://github.com/alterakey/trueseeing)
- [AUSERA](https://github.com/tjusenchen/AUSERA)
- [SPECK](https://github.com/SPRITZ-Research-Group/SPECK)

## Our Goal

- Evaluate SAST tools for Android.
- Get a comprehensive inspection report of the target APK.

- [_Performance of single vulnerability types.md_](https://github.com/android-app-sast/VulsTotal/blob/master/Performance%20of%20single%20vulnerability%20types.md): Tool performance based on a single vulnerability type.
- [_CSV_sample.csv_](https://github.com/android-app-sast/VulsTotal/blob/master/CSV_sample.csv): A sample CSV file of the final report of the target APK generated by VulsTotal.

## The Benchmark Resources
The CVE-based benchmark is available at [https://zenodo.org/records/13208290](https://zenodo.org/records/13208290)

## Configuration Platform VulsTotal
Since the platform integrates the detection capabilities of 11 tools, we need to install each of the 11 tools separately. We will optimize this feature to allow users to access the platform via a web service.
Note that please use the installation packages of the 11 tools provided with this project, as the tools have been modified by us to varying degrees to accommodate the platform.
### The Usage of VulsTotal

## Web Sevice Coming!
In our ongoing efforts to enhance user experience, we have developed a web service designed to streamline and enrich interaction with our platform. After undergoing comprehensive testing to ensure reliability and functionality, this service already have made available to the public!
Visit the website at [vulstotal.com](http://www.vulstotal.com) and you can use it right away. If you encounter any issues during the process, please feel free to raise an issue at GitHub.
