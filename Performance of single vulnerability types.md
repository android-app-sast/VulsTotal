# Performance of single vulnerability types
## Use Allow All Hostname Verification
In terms of "Allow All Hostname Verification," SPECK and APKHunt demonstrate outstanding performance, achieving 100% Recall. QARK's lower Recall rate of 38% is mainly due to missing critical source code components during decompilation. JAADAS records a Recall of 0%, with six out of seven instances failing scanning, while one instance went undetected.
## External/Internal Data Exposure 
For "External/Internal Data Exposure," AUSERA and APKHunt again achieve perfect 100% Recall rates. However, similarly to the Logging data leakage, their high performance stems from different reasons. SUPER only achieves a 17% Recall, largely because its regular expression-based approach covers a limited scope of sensitive APIs, resulting in many missed detections. SPECK's 57% Recall is also due to this factor.
## Misuse Implicit Intent Issue
Regarding "Misuse of Implicit Intent Issues," SPECK and APKHunt once more show strong performance with 100% Recall. JAADAS, on the contrary, has a Recall rate of 33%.
## Use Invalid Hostname Verification
When it comes to "Use Invalid Hostname Verification," APKHunt tops with an 86% Recall, thanks to its broad matching rules. Despite employing AST matching, QARK registers the lowest Recall of 17%, partly due to dependency library issues causing false negatives. For example, in IncorrectHostNameVerification-MITM-Lean-benign.apk [1], even though the key code in MyIntentServlet.java was obtained via decompilation, a bug in the dependency library led to a missed detection.
## Webview JavaScript Execution
In the context of "Webview JavaScript Execution," SPECK and AUSERA both attain 100% Recall, showcasing their high performance. Conversely, QARK, SUPER, and Trueseeing exhibit much lower Recall rates of 0%, 0%, and 17%, respectively. For QARK, dependency library errors again affect the handling of critical code. As for SUPER and Trueseeing, their configured rules require not only detecting the key API 'setJavaScriptEnabled(true)', but also the presence of 'addJavascriptInterface', which leads to many missed detections.
